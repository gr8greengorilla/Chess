# Chess
Able to play games using chess notation. Has support for all chess rules such as en passent and castling, and takes algebraic notation for its moves. Will detect checkmate and stalement.

Code is heavily untested but should be functioning enough, if there is a bug let me know and ill do my best to figure it out :)
